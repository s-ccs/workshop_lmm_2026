# Pluto Pair
Use the pluto-pair MCP server when a task involves Pluto.jl notebook state or controls.
If the user has a Pluto browser window open, prefer live attach first:
- pluto_discover_servers to check local Pluto servers, especially port 1234.
- pluto_attach_session to attach to a notebook already running in that visible server.
- pluto_open_visible to open a notebook in the visible server and attach to it.

Live attached sessions update the same notebook the user sees in their browser.
Use headless tools for isolated checks, CI-like validation, exports, or untrusted/static previews:
- pluto_list_notebooks to discover notebook files.
- pluto_open_notebook to open and execute a trusted notebook. Execution is the default; pass execution_allowed=false only for untrusted preview.
- pluto_list_bonds to inspect @bind variables.
- pluto_set_bonds to set bound values and trigger Pluto reactivity.
- pluto_read_state to summarize code, outputs, errors, logs, and bonds.
- pluto_export_html to write a rendered HTML export.
- pluto_close_notebook when finished. On live attached sessions, this only detaches and does not shut down the user's Pluto notebook.
